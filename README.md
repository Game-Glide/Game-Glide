<h1>More about me</h1>

<p>Im primarily a game developer working in unity, unreal and godot. Mostly unity though. I do also dabble in full stack development on various tech stacks such as MERN, I am most experienced in using react for frontend + rust for backend with MongoDB as a database (sql is gonna be the death of me istg). In other boring things I do include, making game engines in my spare time, staring at my desktop a <b>lot</b> of the time, making mobile apps with react native and flutter, desktop applications with tauri, electron or native C (spiritually and technically superior tbh).

I used to also be heavily involved in making discord bots before the great discord bot nuke of the 22's with slash commands (still hate you for this btw disc :/ ), I primarily used java and javacord and sometimes discord.js when I got tired of using a strongly typed language. My main workstation OS is I use arch btw, check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/Game-Glide/glides-dotfiles) if you wanna see how it looks (pretty please? :D), I also love cool landscape type wallpapers :D (if you got any hmu)

Certified clanker (AI) hater, I've been programming for 10 years without it and Im good without it. if you draw your attention to the below graph, you'll get a good look at how much I like typing on some days and some days not (I still cant touch type btw):
